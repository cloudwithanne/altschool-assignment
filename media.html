                <div>
                    <p>I've always been drawn to technology. Even as a kid, I loved taking apart my old toys and trying to figure out how they worked. 
                    It was the same with computers; I was constantly tinkering with them, trying to fix issues or learn new things. This natural curiosity eventually led me to pursue a career in computer engineering.</p>
                    
                   <p> At first, I explored various areas within computer engineering, from designing flyers to designing applications. But I quickly realized that I wanted to find a field where I could not only apply my technical skills but also make a real difference in the world. Inspired by Steve Jobs' quote, "The only way to do great work is to love what you do," 
                    I knew I needed to find a career that aligned with my passions.</p>

                    <p>That's when I discovered cloud computing. I was immediately intrigued by the potential of building scalable, reliable, and efficient cloud solutions. It was a field that combined my love for technology with my desire to solve real-world problems. With a blend of technical expertise and a passion for innovation, 
                        I'm excited to leverage cloud technologies to drive positive change.</p>

            <p>I listen to Vusi Thembekwayo alot. One of the things he said was, "When you're on the brink of giving up, remember that breakthroughs often come right after the hardest moments. Push through the doubt, keep your eyes on the goal, and stay strong. You’ve come too far to quit now—keep going!."</p>
